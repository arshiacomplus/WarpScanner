## 1. IP scanner is IPv4, IPv6

##### ▫️ The ability to save version four IPs in storage/emulated/0/ and a file called result.csv

##### Therefore, it should be noted that by entering the number one and then y and maybe again y

##### And then you have to give the memory access to Termox that you are asked

##### and then

##### Note: You can create a clean IP for Vahid panel (with inter) and bpb panel (with comma).

##### Save in the result file

##### Then you enter the number one (IP version four)

<br><br/>

## 2. Get Wireguard config

▫️ If you get a timeout error while getting the wireguard configuration, test a few more times<br><br/>

## 3. Get Wireguard configuration without needing to scan IP

(It is for people who get the error best_result[0]Eat) 
 In this case, you can first scan the IP from other scanners 
 And after selecting the third option, you will be asked to enter the IP with the port, or if you enter N, it will select the IP that I have already entered.

<br><br/>

### 4. To receive wireguard configuration in a sub link with the desired number, enter option 4. Try to use even numbers for the configuration number.

If you get a timeout error, try a few more times<br><br/>

## 5. To get Wireguard config for use in v2ray and MahsaNG

> This is for those who get error requests 👈👈<https://t.me/arshia_mod_fun/298>

By entering option 1 and after that 2 
 You can get the IP version of Shish, which is also implemented for Option 5 Wireguard configuration for Mehsa Anji and Vettori.

After copying the Wire Guard configuration with the IP version of Shish and then importing it into the client, do this so that you don't get a bug.

-   1\. Pencil button
-   2\. Putting the bracket next to the IP[ipvsh]
-   3\. Storage<br><br/>

## 6. To get wireguard configuration for Vettori and Mehsa Anji and... without IP scan

If you press n, it will select the IP that I have already set
 otherwise 
 IP with port example:

> ipv4:port
> you enter<br><br/>

## 7. To get config, warp on warp for v2ray and MahsaNG, you can use option 7 (help was taken from the bpb panel....)

You will be asked whether Po sites (Kung Fu Panda) will be blocked or not<br><br/>

## 8. You can sub warp that warp for v2ray or MahsaNg

<br><br/>

## 9. You can make a short cut

Give it a name and close the Thermox window and open a new one.

Type of Use :

-   Enter the name you gave to run the script
-   To delete it, press the same number again and press Y

<br><br/>
